# C++ Cache Simulator Project

## 🔭 Goal
Simulate a two-level cache (L1, L2) using C++ with support for LRU, dirty eviction, and stream prefetching.

## 🧪 Learning Structure
This repo includes a guided **Lab Series** (`labs/`) to build up to the final simulator in `src/`.

## 📁 Folder Overview

| Folder     | Purpose                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `src/`     | Final production code                        |
| `labs/`    | Step-by-step lab exercises with explanations |
| `doc/`     | Provided specs, tips, and course PDFs        |
| `test/`    | Trace input/output files                     |
